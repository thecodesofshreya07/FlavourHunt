                <h1>Chicken Tikka Recipes | How to make Chicken Tikka | Homemade Chicken Tikka</h1>
                <p>Smoky, spicy, and bursting with flavor, chicken tikka is one of the most loved dishes from Indian cuisine. Marinated in a blend of yogurt and aromatic spices, the chicken is grilled or roasted to perfection, resulting in juicy pieces with a delicious charred edge. Whether served on its own, with naan, or as part of a larger meal, chicken tikka is always a crowd-pleaser that brings bold, mouthwatering flavor to your plate.</p>
                <p>To make chicken tikka, you’ll need boneless chicken pieces—preferably thigh or breast—thick curd or hung yogurt, lemon juice, and oil. The marinade is what gives this dish its signature taste, made with a blend of spices like red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, cumin, coriander powder, ginger-garlic paste, and a pinch of salt. Optional additions include kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and a dash of food color for that bright orange hue often seen in restaurant-style tikka.</p>

Begin by cutting the chicken into medium-sized chunks and patting them dry. In a large mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, oil, and all the spices to form a thick, flavorful marinade. Add the chicken pieces to this mixture, coating them thoroughly. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2–4 hours, or overnight for the best flavor and tenderness.
When you're ready to cook, preheat your oven or grill. If you're using an oven, line a baking tray with foil and place a rack on top so the chicken cooks evenly and gets a nice char. Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers if you like, or place them directly on the rack. Roast at a high temperature—around 200°C (390°F)—for 20–25 minutes, turning once halfway through. You can also grill the chicken on an open flame or cook it on a hot tawa or grill pan if you prefer the stovetop method. Baste the chicken occasionally with melted butter or oil for added richness and that slight smokiness.
Once cooked, the chicken should be slightly charred on the edges and juicy inside. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander, onion rings, lemon wedges, and a sprinkle of chaat masala for that final touch. Serve it hot as an appetizer, in wraps, or paired with mint chutney and naan for a fulfilling meal.
Chicken tikka is a vibrant, flavor-packed dish that’s surprisingly easy to make at home and guaranteed to impress anyone who tastes it.
