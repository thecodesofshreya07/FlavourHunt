                <h1>Donut Recipes | How to make Donut | Homemade Donut Recipes</h1>
                <p>There’s something truly magical about a freshly made donut—soft, golden, and slightly crisp on the outside, yet fluffy and sweet on the inside. Whether glazed, dusted with sugar, or dipped in chocolate, donuts are a timeless delight that bring joy with every bite. And the best part? You can recreate that bakery-style goodness right at home.
                </p>
                <p>To prepare these homemade donuts, you’ll need all-purpose flour, warm milk, sugar, instant yeast, salt, eggs, unsalted butter, and a dash of vanilla extract. For frying, go with a neutral oil like vegetable or sunflower oil. You can top them with a classic sugar glaze, melted chocolate, or even cinnamon sugar—whatever your heart (and taste buds) desire.

Start by warming the milk slightly—not too hot—and dissolving a spoonful of sugar in it. Sprinkle in the yeast and let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it becomes foamy. This step is essential for activating the yeast. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, remaining sugar, and salt. Add in the foamy yeast mixture, eggs, softened butter, and vanilla extract. Mix everything until a dough begins to form, then knead it by hand or with a dough hook until it’s smooth and elastic. This may take around 8–10 minutes.
Once kneaded, cover the dough with a clean cloth and let it rise in a warm spot for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size. After the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release the air. Roll it out on a floured surface to about half an inch thick. Using a donut cutter (or two differently sized round cutters), shape the donuts and place them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Let them rest again for 20–30 minutes so they puff up slightly.
Heat the oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Test the temperature by dropping in a small piece of dough—it should sizzle and rise to the top. Gently add the donuts in batches, frying each side until golden brown, which should take about 1–2 minutes per side. Once cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
While the donuts are still warm, dip them into your glaze or sprinkle with your preferred topping. Let them set for a few minutes, then serve and enjoy the soft, delicious goodness you just created from scratch.
