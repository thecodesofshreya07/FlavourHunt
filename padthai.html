                <h1>Pad Thai Recipes | How to make Pad Thai | Homemade Pad Thai</h1>
                <p>Pad Thai is a vibrant and flavorful Thai stir-fried noodle dish that’s beloved around the world for its perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy notes. With soft rice noodles, crunchy peanuts, fresh vegetables, and your choice of protein, every bite is packed with texture and taste. It's quick to prepare and makes a satisfying meal that brings authentic Thai street food straight to your kitchen.</p>
                <p>To make Pad Thai, you’ll need flat rice noodles, which are soaked until soft. The sauce is a key component, made from tamarind paste, fish sauce or soy sauce, sugar, and a bit of chili powder for heat. For the protein, you can use shrimp, chicken, tofu, or eggs. Add-ins typically include bean sprouts, garlic, green onions, and crushed roasted peanuts. Lime wedges and fresh coriander are often served on the side for garnish and an extra burst of freshness.</p>

Start by soaking the rice noodles in warm water for about 30 minutes or until they’re pliable but not mushy. While the noodles are soaking, mix the Pad Thai sauce in a small bowl by combining tamarind paste, fish sauce or soy sauce, a bit of water, sugar, and chili powder. Adjust the proportions according to your preferred taste—sweeter, tangier, or spicier.
Heat a wok or large pan over medium-high heat and add a bit of oil. Sauté chopped garlic until golden, then add your choice of protein—shrimp, chicken slices, or tofu cubes—and cook until done. Push the protein to the side of the pan and crack in an egg, scrambling it quickly until cooked.
Drain the noodles and add them to the pan along with the prepared sauce. Stir everything together, tossing gently to coat the noodles evenly. If the noodles seem dry, add a splash of water to loosen them up. Add bean sprouts and chopped green onions, tossing for a minute or two just until everything is combined and heated through.
Once cooked, transfer the Pad Thai to a plate and sprinkle generously with crushed peanuts. Garnish with lime wedges and fresh coriander. Serve immediately while hot, and let each person squeeze lime juice over the noodles for that zesty finish.
Homemade Pad Thai is a deliciously quick dish that brings a taste of Thailand to your table—comforting, flavorful, and ready in minutes.
