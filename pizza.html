                </p>
                <p>To make a simple homemade pizza, you'll need all-purpose flour, warm water, active dry yeast, olive oil, salt, and a pinch of sugar for the dough. For the sauce, use crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. For toppings, grab some shredded mozzarella cheese and add any extras you like, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, or fresh basil.

Start by preparing the dough. Mix warm water with a pinch of sugar and active dry yeast, and let it sit for about 5 to 10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt, then add the yeast mixture along with olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead it on a floured surface for about 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size.
While the dough is rising, make the sauce. Heat olive oil in a small pan over medium heat, add minced garlic, and sauté for about 30 seconds. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes until slightly thickened, then set it aside to cool.
Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out into a round shape. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C), and if using a pizza stone or baking tray, let it heat in the oven. Spread a layer of the sauce over the rolled-out dough, sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese, and add your favorite toppings.
Transfer the pizza onto the hot stone or tray and bake for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned. Let it cool for a couple of minutes, slice it up, and enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!
