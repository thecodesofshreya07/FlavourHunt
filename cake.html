                <h1>Cake Recipes | How to make Cakes | Homemade Cake Recipes</h1>
                <p>There’s nothing quite like the aroma of a freshly baked cake filling your kitchen—a warm, sweet scent that instantly feels like home. Whether it’s for a celebration or just a cozy treat, a homemade cake brings joy in every soft, spongy slice. With simple ingredients and a little love, you can bake a cake that’s moist, flavorful, and absolutely irresistible.
                </p>
                <p>To bake a classic vanilla cake, you’ll need all-purpose flour, sugar, eggs, baking powder, a pinch of salt, milk, unsalted butter, and vanilla essence. For a chocolate variation, you can add cocoa powder to the mix. You may also want to keep some ingredients handy for frosting—like powdered sugar, butter, cocoa, or cream—depending on the style of cake you’re going for. Begin by preheating your oven to 180°C (350°F) and greasing a cake tin with butter or lining it with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This step helps create a soft texture for the cake. Next, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, and mix in the vanilla essence

In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with milk. Stir gently until everything is well combined and forms a smooth batter. If you're making a chocolate cake, mix cocoa powder with the dry ingredients before combining.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and gently tap it on the counter to remove air bubbles. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for around 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Avoid opening the oven too early, as this can cause the cake to sink.
Once baked, let the cake cool in the tin for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. You can leave it plain for a simple tea cake or decorate it with frosting once cooled. For a basic buttercream, beat softened butter with powdered sugar and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth and creamy. Spread it over the top or layer it in between slices if you’ve baked multiple layers.
Serve your homemade cake with tea, coffee, or just on its own—it’s a slice of comfort that’s perfect any time of the day.
