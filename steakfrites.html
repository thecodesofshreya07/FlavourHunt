                <h1>Steak Frites Recipes | How to make Steak Frites | Homemade Steak Frites</h1>
                <p>Steak frites is the perfect example of simple ingredients coming together to create something truly special. A beloved French classic, it pairs a juicy, seared steak with a generous side of crispy, golden fries. It’s the kind of dish that feels both indulgent and comforting, perfect for a weekend dinner or when you want to treat yourself to a restaurant-style meal at home.</p>
                <p>To prepare steak frites, you’ll need a good quality steak—ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon are popular choices—along with potatoes, oil for frying, butter, garlic, and fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary. Salt and freshly ground black pepper are essential for seasoning. For extra richness, you can also make a simple pan sauce or herb butter to serve over the steak.</p>

Start with the fries, as they take a bit longer. Peel the potatoes and cut them into thin strips, then soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. This step helps make them extra crispy when cooked. After soaking, drain and pat them completely dry with a towel. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pan, and fry the potatoes in batches until pale golden—this is the first fry. Let them rest on paper towels while you prepare the steak.
Take your steak out of the fridge about 20–30 minutes before cooking so it can come to room temperature. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper. Heat a skillet or grill pan over high heat and add a bit of oil. Once hot, place the steak in the pan and sear it for a few minutes on each side, depending on the thickness and your preferred doneness. For added flavor, reduce the heat slightly and add butter, garlic cloves, and herbs to the pan. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak as it cooks for a rich, aromatic finish.
Once the steak is done, transfer it to a plate and let it rest for about 5–10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the meat tender and flavorful. While the steak rests, return your fries to the hot oil for a second fry. This final step makes them golden, crispy, and irresistible. Drain on paper towels and season with a little salt while they're still hot.
Plate the steak next to a generous heap of fries, and top the meat with a pat of herb butter or drizzle with pan sauce if you like. Steak frites is all about balance—the crispness of the fries perfectly complements the juicy tenderness of the steak, making it a meal that’s satisfying, timeless, and absolutely delicious.
